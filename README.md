# SocialConect
Social media has become a central part of modern digital experiences, enabling meaningful connections and self-expression online. Instagram specifically brought photo-focused social networking mainstream, amassing over 1 billion monthly active users as of 2022. This project aims to understand the core features and infrastructure empowering Instagram by recreating a simplified version – “Pictogram” – focusing on its photo sharing and commenting capabilities.

Besides honing hard skills, coordinating all facets of this project myself - from planning sprints to acting on user feedback after launches - helped me grow tremendously as an independent developer. Learning to rely on my own intuition and decisions has increased my confidence and leadership instincts crucial for future undertakings. Support from my advisor and cheerleaders fortified me to power through to the rewarding finish line.
